Testing instructions: 

1. When a game is in progress, you will see a message in the top right corner of the screen, asking you to type !play in the twitch chat to join the game.  This message will only appear during the game,  and is not visible in between games, when leader boards are shown.
2. When you join the game, your personal in-game data will appear in the same corner of the screen. You will see some values change depending on your actions in the game. This view will stay there until current game ends, and then the process will repeat.
3. Instructions on how to play the game can be found in the stream description on [the main channel](twitch.tv/twitchplayssc) and in [the wiki](https://twitchplayssc.fandom.com/wiki/)

General description

This extension is to be used on the twitchplayssc channel only. 
The channel itself allows twitch users send commands to the instance of Starcraft II, which we run locally, and in that, effectively play the game.
The extension serves as a helper tool for players, showing player specific in-game stats. 
The extension connects to a dedicated server, which identifies the user based on the 'Authorization' header and returns all the data, which is then rendered in the view
